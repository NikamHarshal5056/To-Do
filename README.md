Create a dynamic and user-friendly To-Do App using EJS, Node.js, and Express. This web application allows users to easily add, edit, and manage their tasks in an intuitive interface. Users can create new tasks with titles and descriptions, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks when they're done. The app leverages EJS templates for rendering the front-end views, while Node.js and Express handle the server-side logic, enabling seamless task management. With this project, you'll build a practical and responsive To-Do App that helps users stay organized and productive.
